NTU Statistic HW3 Normal Distribution & Exponential Distribution

#Questions

1. a.Draw 𝑛𝑛 values from a uniform distribution between -2 and 2 and calculate the sample mean. as 𝑛𝑛 gets larger?Do this 200 times for 𝑛𝑛 = 2, 5, 15, and 30. Make a histogram for each case. What do you find
2. Draw 𝑛𝑛 values from an exponential distribution with λ = 1.5 and calculate the sample mean. Do this 200 times for 𝑛𝑛 = 2, 5, 15, and 30. Make a histogram of the sample means for each case. What do you find as 𝑛𝑛 gets larger?

#Anwser:

#1
meanresult2 <- c()
for (i in 1:200){
    samplex <- runif(2, min=-2 , max=2)
    meanresult2[i] <- mean(samplex)
}
hist(meanresult2)

meanresult5 <- c()
for (i in 1:200){
  samplex <- runif(5, min=-2 , max=2)
  meanresult5[i] <- mean(samplex)
}
hist(meanresult5)

meanresult15 <- c()
for (i in 1:200){
  samplex <- runif(15, min=-2 , max=2)
  meanresult15[i] <- mean(samplex)
}
hist(meanresult15)

meanresult30 <- c()
for (i in 1:200){
  samplex <- runif(30, min=-2 , max=2)
  meanresult30[i] <- mean(samplex)
}
hist(meanresult30)

-> When n gets larger, the distribution is more like a normal distribution. (According to Central Limit Theorem)

#2
meanresult2 <- c()
for (i in 1:200){
  samplex <- rexp(2, rate = 1.5)
  meanresult2[i] <- mean(samplex)
}
hist(meanresult2)

meanresult5 <- c()
for (i in 1:200){
  samplex <- rexp(5, rate = 1.5)
  meanresult5[i] <- mean(samplex)
}
hist(meanresult5)

meanresult15 <- c()
for (i in 1:200){
  samplex <- rexp(15, rate = 1.5)
  meanresult15[i] <- mean(samplex)
}
hist(meanresult15)

meanresult30 <- c()
for (i in 1:200){
  samplex <- rexp(30, rate = 1.5)
  meanresult30[i] <- mean(samplex)
}
hist(meanresult30)
