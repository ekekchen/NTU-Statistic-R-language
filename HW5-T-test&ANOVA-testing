Download the data set china from https://bit.ly/2ZxoZkU, which was collected from the 2006 China Health and Nutrition Survey conducted by the UNC Carolina Population Center. The Survey aims to examine the effects of the health, nutrition, and family planning policies and programs implemented by national and local governments. The variable definition is summarized in the following table.

Gender of the parent: 
1 = male
2 = female

Educational attainment of the parent: 
1 = graduated from primary school
2 = lower middle school degree
3 = upper middle school degree
4 = technical or vocational degree 5 = university or college degree
6 = master’s degree or higher
9 = unknown
Hours spent on childcare during the past week, = -99 if unknown
For the analysis below, you need to first drop the observations with a missing value for any of the variables.

1. Make a summary statistics table that includes the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for child_care. Make a histogram for child_care.
2. Make a summary statistics table that includes the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for child_care by parents’ gender. Make histograms of child_care by parents’ gender. Compare the distribution of child_care between males and females.
3. Is there a difference in the average childcare hours between males and females? Draw a conclusion using both the critical value approach and p-value approach.
4. Make a summary statistics table that includes the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for child_care by parents’ education levels. Make side-by-side box plots for child_care by parents’ education levels. Compare the distribution of child_care among parents’ education levels.
5. Do average childcare hours vary with parents’ education? Draw a conclusion using both the critical value approach and p-value approach.

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  child_care by gender
t = -8.2549, df = 796.45, p-value = 6.291e-16
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0

-> p-value is less than 0.05, reject H0, which means there is difference between childcare of male and female.
-> The absolute value of t-test (critical value) is 8.2549 > 1.9629, reject H0, which means there is difference between childcare of male and female.
